# .prtgn
A Protogen file extension written in Rust. 

## A few other protogen repositories 

[Proto-OS](https://github.com/dimitrivlachos/Proto-OS), "An operating system for a Protogen head which utilises computer vision and machine learning to replicate the user's facial expressions and eye position onto the exterior displays of the character head. Made for an RPI4." -- [dimitrivlachos](https://github.com/dimitrivlachos)

[Proto-Ear-Twitch](https://github.com/stef1949/Proto-Ear-Twitch), "Code for controlling protogen ears" -- [stef1949](https://github.com/stef1949)

[ProtogenHelmet-ESP32](https://github.com/NCPlyn/ProtogenHelmet-ESP32), "Controller & Remote & Animator for Furry Protogen helmet using ESP32-S3 & MAX7219/WS2812" -- [NCPlyn](https://github.com/NCPlyn)

## Plans

Rataui for a CLI UI for file editing and all sorts of stuff -- https://ratatui.rs/tutorials/json-editor/ \\ https://ratatui.rs \\ https://github.com/rhysd/tui-textarea

CLI command (prtgn) for doing things. Example, `prtgn new <filename>` or something like that would create a new file and open the file editing UI -- https://rust.code-maven.com/clap-subcommand \\ https://medium.com/coderhack-com/writing-a-cli-tool-in-rust-237d7e6417f6s \\ https://rust-cli.github.io/book/tutorial/index.html

Custom 'encryption', similar to that of Hexidecimal or Binary or something but not.
