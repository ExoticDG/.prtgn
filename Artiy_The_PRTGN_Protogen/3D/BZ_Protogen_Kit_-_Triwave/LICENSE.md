> Hello! Whether you've downloaded the entire file, or you've downloaded the parts you need, thank you for downloading the BZ Protogen Kit! I really > appreciate it!
> I've been working on this for quite a bit, I hope you enjoy it!
>
> Included are BLEND files, Substance Files, Example Textures, UVs, and a Unity Package that comes with an Action Menu that allows you to swap out features on the fly.
> Please read the other text files in this folder for more information about the files provided!
>
> BLENDER 3.0 IS REQUIRED TO OPEN THE BLEND FILES.
> If you use Blender Versions 2.7x or under, you can set your keymap as the "Blender 2.7x" keymap preset in Blender 3.0's settings!
>
> SUBSTANCE PAINTER 2020 OR ABOVE IS REQUIRED TO OPEN THE SUBSTANCE PAINTER FILES.
> This model was designed with PBR in mind, and was made with a workflow that uses Substance Painter!
> Substance Painter is HIGHLY recommended when it comes to retexturing this model, as you'll be able to make your own textures easily and export texture sets that can be used with Unity right away.
> You'll also be able to fully use the example masks/patterns I have provided in the Substance Painter files.
>
>
> When it comes to Unity/VRChat, this model actually uses Unity's Standard shaders! No extra shaders are required for this model.
>
> This Model is NOT Quest-compatible.
> The polycount goes over the current 20,000 polygon limit, so unfortunately the model will not be visible for quest users.
> (If topology doesn't bug you too much, and quest isn't your highest priority, you might be able to use Blender or a Unity addon and reduce the polycount.)
