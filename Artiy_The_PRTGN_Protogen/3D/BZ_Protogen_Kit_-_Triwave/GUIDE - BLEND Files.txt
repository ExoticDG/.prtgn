- Sharp Visor clipping error has been fixed.
	There was a mesh error with the sharp visor, the head would clip outside. This is no longer the case.

BLENDER 3.0 IS REQUIRED.

The BLEND files should be pretty straightforward. Included is the same model used for the Unity Package.
The interchangeable features are all joined into 3 meshes. Not to worry, you can split them up by moving the root bones associated with those features and separate them from the mesh if you need to!

Unfortunately, some parts of the model need to be triangulated due to how the normal maps work. If certain parts are untriangulated, the chest fur and such look kind of ugly haha.
