[UPDATE, APRIL 21 2022] 
- The model now features Physbone Components! In the scene provided, physbones are included for the tails, chest fur, and hair. 
	FX layers, Tail toggle animations, and Chest Fur toggle animations have been adjusted for these changes.
- Sharp Visor clipping error has been fixed.
	There was a mesh error with the sharp visor, the head would clip outside. This is no longer the case.
- Clapping is a toggle now.

If you have downloaded the Unity File, and the file shows"BZProtogenKit.unitypackage.gz", simply remove the .gz part and it should work iirc!

The Unity Package includes components for a VRChat avatar that allows you to swap features on the fly! (Eye/Mouth types, tails, horns, etc.)
THIS AVATAR USES SDK3, PLEASE USE UNITY 2019.4.31f1 AND BE SURE THAT THE LATEST VRCSDK PACKAGE HAS BEEN IMPORTED INTO YOUR PROJECT BEFORE IMPORTING THE PROTOGEN PACKAGE!

This model uses the Standard Unity shaders, so you don't have to download any other shaders if you don't want to!

- Useful info. -
	- THERE ARE ADDITIONAL BLENDSHAPES THAT YOU CAN USE OUTSIDE OF THE ACTION MENU! 
		(These include several blendshapes for altering proportions, an alternate nose, and resizing the panel fins! Feel free to change these in the editor, as they aren't affected by animations.)
	- Model is scaled down to 0.44. This is the intended scale of the model!
	- Rather than using mesh visibility, root bones are used to show and hide the different features. This bumps the performance rank up to medium. 
		Not to worry though, the face/visors are separate from the body to hopefully prevent too many blendshape performance issues.
	- The "Body" mesh is the mesh for the visor/face, and should be used as the mesh for Viseme Blend Shape Lip-syncing.
	- The "Model" mesh refers to the body.
	- For the VRC AVATAR DESCRIPTOR'S Playable Layers, use either the "ProtoFX" file or the "ProtoFX (With Gestures Layer)" file. The latter option will give you facial expressions on certain hand gestures!
	- For the VRC AVATAR DESCRIPTOR'S Expressions, make sure that the Menu is set to "ProtoActionMenu" and the Parameters are set to "ProtoParameters".
	- Expression Menus and Parameters can be found inside th "VRCAvatarStuff" folder.

- How to set specific features as the default option for your avatar. -
For specific characters, it can be convenient to have the avatar's default settings resemble your character.
This can be done in Blender. However, for those who want the swappable features still intact, and also want the default settings to resemble their own protogen, here's a neat trick you can do!

	- Go to the "VRCAvatarStuff" folder and click on the "ProtoParameters" file and change the parameters so that the default variables for your character are set to be active.
		- "EyeType" Parameters -
		Neutral Eyes - 0
		Mean Eyes - 1
		Stoic Eyes - 2

		- "Tail" Parameters -
		Standard Tail - 0
		Short Tail - 1
		Mechanical Tail - 2
		Aquatic Tail - 3

		- "VisorType" Parameters -
		Dome Visor - 0
		Angled Visor - 1
		Sharp Visor - 2

		- "Horns" Parameters - 
		No Horns - 0
		Short Horns - 1
		Medium Horns - 2
		Big Horns - 3

		- "Hair" Parameters -
		No Hair - 0
		Short/Messy Hair - 1
		Long Hair - 2

	- [OPTIONAL] Once you have done that, feel free to change the scale of the bones for the features that you don't want as default to 0, 0, 0. 
		Don't worry! You will still be able to access these through the action menu. It just hides them in the avatar selection menu, so they don't appear for a split second when you spawn in!
	
	- Then, feel free to test or upload your avatar!

Hope you enjoy the Avatar!
