SUBSTANCE PAINTER 2020 (6.2.2) OR ABOVE IS REQUIRED. Unfortunately, it doesn't let you open the file on older versions of Substance Painter. This is the oldest version of Substance Painter I have, so I apologize.

The Substance Painter Files should also be pretty straightforward. 
The Standard Armor is split off into a separate substance painter file in order to allow for custom armor designs. The Tails and horns are split into their own material for the same reason.

For the fur, a lot of the different example patterns are hidden layers in the materials. Simply unhide one of these layers to use it.
The extra ears have their own UV space. In order to paint on the extra set of ears, simply hide the "(Ears) Uncommon Hidden" layer. The extra ears should appear.

For the armor, there are two main folders. 
One includes the base standard armor design/plating. 
The other one features a more blank design, for those who would like to create their own plating/armor designs.
